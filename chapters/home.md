# C++ - An Intermediate Guide by Andrea Torti

A concise, practical guide for learning and experimenting with some modern C++ features. Includes some theory, lots of code snippets, and small runnable projects too!

This guide is meant for people with a background in C and Object Oriented Programming, and a strong grasp on low level concepts like pointers, stack and heap, just wanting to learn more about the C++ language itself.

This language main strength is it being multipagadigm: like no building is made up of a single material, each piece of a software should be made with the right tools.
